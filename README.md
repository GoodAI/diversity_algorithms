# Diversity algorithms

This fork contains changes to make it possible to communicate with the Space Engineers game.

## Changes

- Changed log file names so that they are valid on Windows
- Slightly changed the NS+Fit option handling because I was getting some errors with the shape of the fitness. There is probably a better solution.
- Added a Space Engineers maze environment.
- Added a file to export behaviour descriptors to a text file so that they can be rendered in the game.

## How to install

- Install diversity_algorithms (instructions [here](https://github.com/robotsthatdream/diversity_algorithms))
- Install Space Engineers gym (instructions [here](https://github.com/GoodAI/SpaceEngineersGym))

*Notes:*
Scoop is not working with the Space Engineers gym.
